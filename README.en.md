# Chinese Football Clubs Badges

Collect and organize the vector graphics of Chinese football clubs badges for learning and reference.

All logos are available in two versions: (01) multicolor and (02) monochrome version.

Because the Chinese clubs lack team culture construction, some original design material is difficult to collect (especially for low-level league clubs), so there are some logos that may differ slightly from the original design in details.
